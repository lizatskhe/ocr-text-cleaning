{"0": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHEsuperstition upon which this taIe i\u017f founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabjans itappeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establi shment of Christianity; and it has only a\u017fsumed its prosent form since the division af the Latin and Greok churches; at which time, lhe idea becoming prevalent, that a Lcltin body could not corrvpl if buried in their territory, it gradually increosed, and formed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, \u017ftill extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding uponlhe blood of tho young and beautiful. In the West itspread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of c0nsumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as t0 cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even fr0m the ucry pores of thoir skins.\nIn theLond0n Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to hove accurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of tbe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had bcen beclrd to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the fr0ntiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing him\u017felf with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre him\u017fels; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of hauing 6een tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the lnhabitants havjng consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f ound it (a\u017f is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely lhrough the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out cls dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut ofs his head, burned his body, and threw lhe asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of th ose persons who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.\nThe universa1 belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, arid sucks in his turn.\nChlef bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject of the prcsent o6servations than any other iristance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of pvnishment after doatb, for some hein ous crime commjtted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not anly doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut fir\u017ft on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy cor\u017fe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living cor\u017fe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvr\u017fing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her c heek's last tinge\u2014hor eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freozes o'er its lifeless b1ue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wheri sborn Affcction's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen gravc, Go\u2014arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrjnk away From spcctre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulne\u017fs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciou\u017f Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his greot work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of jts effects, has put forth \u017fome learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.\nMany curious and intcresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may suffiee for the limjts of a note, nece\u017fsarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be conc1uded 6y merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, thcre are scvercll others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms \u017fince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:\u2014thoughin vain:\u2014when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her 's, \u017ftill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;\u2014evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wcls baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the comm0n adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hi\u017f eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang tho\u017fe who sully it by their vices.\nAhout the \u017fame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than hi\u017f judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the vcsting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nhter\u017f at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. Fjnding, however, some compensati0n in bis gratified vanity, he was aboul to reliriqvishhis dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbe vory impossibility of forming an idea of the charocler af a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gaue few other signs of hif obseruation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his irnagination t0 picture every thlng that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inta the ber0 of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather thanthe persori besore him. He became acqv ainted with him, paid him atteritions, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his presenco was alwoys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarrafsod, and soon found, from the notes of preparatlon in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirou\u017f of gaining some informalion respeeling this \u017firigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thot il was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been tbougbl necessary to enoble lbe yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards putti ng themselves upon an equality with the oged, and not allowing them to appear as if falleri froin the skies,whenever scaridalovs intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pralse, accordlrig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-\nttered by such a mark of estcem frorn him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waterf.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and n0w he fovnd, that, though many more of bis actians were exposed to his viow, the results offered different concluslons from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reeeived from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms;\u2014these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when thc profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in hjs lust, or to sink him sti1l deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributedby him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity 0f his Lordship, which was stlll more lmpresfed up0n his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot therewas a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckle\u017fs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cur\u017fing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp-\nerienoed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbj\u017f to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and dld not terid to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hi\u017f eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rny\u017ftery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.\nThey s0on arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circlc of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the memorials of another almost desertod cily. Whilst he wa\u017f thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothirig but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that thcre was an evil power resident in his companion, these soemed to glve hjm sufficienl reason f0rthe belief. His guardians jnsisted upon his immedialely leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresjstible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discouered, that his contempt for the a dultress had not originated in hatred of hercharacter; but thot he had reqvired, to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnclcIe of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hod, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whose cbclracter had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which t0 rest tbe eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the \u017fame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hiin his intenlions wlth respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sont hi\u017f scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving lest Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of anclent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many co1oured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exlsted a being, so beautiful and delicate, thal she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass tbe promised hope osthe saithful in Mahomet's parcldise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plajn, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof hcr becluties; for who would have exchangcd hcr eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gazc of him, who forgot lhe letters he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosl effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-Iike figure. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preseruo a memorjaI for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all thc glowing colours af youthsul memory,the marriage pomp \u017fhe remernbered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjoctsthat had evidentIy madc a greater impre\u017fsion upon her mjnd, would tell him all the superriatural talcs of her nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited tho interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, wha had passed years amidst his fricnds, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon tbe life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existerice for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe citedto him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hirn so incredulous, she begged of him to bclieve her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alway\u017f had some proof giveri, which obljged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve.She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, \u017ftill persisted in persuclding her, that thore could 6e na truth in her fears, though at the same tirne he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to excjte a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\nAubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and whlle he ridjculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to pclrt from him witb roluclarice; but it was becaufe she had rio longer any one with whom sbe could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursion\u017f, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the pla ce, thoy all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must nocessarily pasf through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, vpon any con\u017fideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his darjng thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.\nNext m0rriing Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind lhat his words, mocking the bolief of those horri6le fiends, had lnspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, thal he did not perceive tbat doy-light would soon ond, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidIy gather into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to mako up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediate1y tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wclf above\u2014lts echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst thc blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hi\u017f uery feet. Suddenly his horse toak srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the t0wn, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, fora moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, contjnued iri one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door os the hut. He f0und himsclf in utter darkness: the sound, h0wever, guidedhim. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in c0n tacl with some one, whom he jmmediately \u017feized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" t0 which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had pIaced bis hands upon his thraat\u2014when thc glare of mony torches penetrating through the hole thclt gave light in the day, disturbod him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl momenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke throvgh the wood, was rio longer heard. Thc st0rm was now stiIl; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered; tbe light of their torches fell upon the mvd wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the lighl of tbe torches once mare burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was 6ut a visjon arisirig from hls disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness abaut her foce that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickIy formed, and Au6rey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him thc objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were\u2014his mirid was benumbed and seemcd to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy\u2014he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engagedjn the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. \u2014To describe their grlef would be impossible; but whenthey ascertained the cause 0f their child'f death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointcd to the corse. They were inconsolable; botb died br0ken-hearted."}
